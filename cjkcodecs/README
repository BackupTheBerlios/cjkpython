Introduction
------------

This package provides Unicode codecs that make Python aware of
CJK (Chinese, Japanese and Korean) encodings such as EUC-JP,
ISO-2022-KR, BIG5 and GB18030. By using this package, their
characters can be treated as a character string instead of a
byte sequence.

The Unicode-related API in Python was proposed by Marc-Andre
Lemburg and defined in the following specification:

  http://starship.python.net/crew/lemburg/unicode-proposal.txt

The provided codecs follow the proposal version 1.8.  Please
consult the specification for the details of the codecs.

The latest version of this package is available at:

  http://cjkpython.berlios.de/#CJKCodecs


Requirement
-----------

This package requires Python 2.1 or later.


This package can be easily installed by means of the Distutils
(Python Distribution Utilities).  Simply issue the following
command, after being root if necessary:

  python setup.py install

If you don't need full supports for all the encodings, you can
specify the following options:

  --disable-japanese                don't install Japanese codecs
  --disable-korean                  don't install Korean codecs
  --disable-simplified-chinese      don't install Simplified Chinese codecs
  --disable-traditional-chinese     don't install Traditional Chinese codecs
