Changes with CJKCodecs 1.0.2

  *) Fixed a weird behavior that str.encode encodes from in-memory
     represention of unicode object directly. Codecs now decode as default
     encoding before encoding str object.

  *) "-strict" flavored codecs are added. While main codecs include several
     tweaks to cope with wild compatibility issues, -strict codecs enable
     pedantic people live a standard life.

  *) SHIFT-JIS codec is now compatible with JapaneseCodecs' by default.
     - U+005C REVERSE SOLIDUS is mapped to SHIFT-JIS 0x5c.
     - U+007E TILDE is mapped to SHIFT-JIS 0x7e.
     - U+FF3C FULL-WIDTH REVERSE SOLIDUS is mapped to SHIFT-JIS 815f.

  *) EUC-JP codec is now compatible with JapaneseCodecs' by default.
     - U+00A5 YEN SIGN is mapped to EUC-JP 0x5c. (one way)
     - U+203E OVERLINE is mapped to EUC-JP 0x7e. (one way)

  *) Several aliases are added for compatibility.
     - ISO-2022-JP-1: ISO-2022-JP-EXT
     - BIG5: BIG5-TW
     - GB2312: EUCGB2312-CN


Changes with CJKCodecs 1.0.1

  *) Fixed a bug that decoders' returning u'' not (u'', 0) when decoding
     empty string. [Tae-Wook Kang]

  *) ISO-2022-JP-2 codec now can process both of G2-assigning 96-charsets;
     ISO-8859-1 and ISO-8859-7.


Changes with CJKCodecs 1.0

  *) UTF-16 codecs are removed from distribution.

  *) Fixed UTF-7 codec's bug that fails to decode surrogate pair on
     ucs4-python.


Changes with CJKCodecs 1.0b1

  *) SHIFT-JISX0213, EUC-JISX0213, ISO-2022-JP-2 and ISO-2022-JP-3
     codec is added.

  *) UTF-7, UTF-16, UTF-16BE and UTF-16LE codec is added.

  *) Changed a few characters of a big5 codepoint mapping to cp950's
     rather than 0xfffd. (documented on NOTES.big5)

  *) Fixed a bug that JIS X 0201 routine doesn't encode and decode 0x7f.

  *) Tweaked some mapping for cp932 and cp950 to make more consistency
     with MS Windows.
     - CP932: Added single byte "UNDEFINED" characters 0x80, 0xa0, 0xfd,
              0xfe, 0xff (documented on NOTES.cp932)
     - CP950: Changed encode mappings to another more popular for
              duplicated unicode points: 5341 -> A451, 5345 -> A4CA

  *) A unittest for big5 mapping is added.

  *) Fixed a bug that cp932 codec couldn't decode half-width katakana.

  *) Added a workaround for PyObject_GenericGetAttr to enable compiling
     with mingw32. [Young-Sik Won]

  *) Enable gb18030 and utf-8 codec encode and decode iso-10646-2
     characters using surrogate pair.

  *) Fixed gb18030 codec's syntax error that disturbs compilation on
     python compiled with --with-unicode=ucs4 option. [Son, Kyung-uk]

  *) StreamWriter became to be able to buffer incomplete sequences.
     (this feature is used for surrogate-pair and mapping from unicode
      character with a following modifier)

  *) EUC-JP codec's mapping for 0xA1C0 is changed from U+005C to
     U+FF3C because EUC-JP 0x5C is also a REVERSE SOLIDUS and 0xA1C0 is
     FULLWIDTH REVERSE SOLIDUS on japanese environments.

  *) Fixed hz codec's bug that doesn't initialize the encoding mode to
     ASCII.
